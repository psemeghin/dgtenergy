# README V2  
  
  
**DGTEnergy – Documentation Repository**  
  
This repository consolidates the institutional, technical and operational documents that define the DGTEnergy protocol. It serves as the single source of truth for engineering, audit, compliance, governance and operational execution.  
  
All documents are in English and aligned with MiCA, FINMA and CVM 188/23 utility-token standards.  

Institutional Version Whitepaper added @3:15pm - check it for deeper understanding.

**1. Start Here — Review Context**  
  
**01_Henry’s Q&A**  
  
Start with this document.  
  
It compiles every question raised by Henry during his institutional review of the previous Whitepaper version and maps each answer to the exact sections updated in the current Institutional Whitepaper (V3).  
It is the **driver** that triggered the refinement of the Whitepaper and the tokenomics structure.  
  
⸻  
  
  
**00_02_V3_Whitepaper Public Edition**  
  
Public-facing edition, simplified and narrative, aligned with the institutional version.  
  
⸻  
  
**3. Tokenomics Layer**  
  
**00_04_Tokenomics Institutional Extended**  
  
The structural tokenomics model – the technical foundation for protocol logic.  
  
**00_05_Tokenomics Public Edition**  
  
A lighter, communication-oriented version consistent with the Institutional Extended.  
  
⸻  
  
**4. Business Requirements Layer**  
  
**00_Business Requirements Master Note**  
  
Functional and non-functional requirements derived from Tokenomics + Whitepaper.  
  
⸻  
  
**5. Architecture and Technical Layer**  
  
**01_Architecture Diagram Pack**  
  
Full architectural mapping (on-chain, off-chain, Treasury, Desk, Staking, Data).  
  
**02_Sequence Diagram Pack**  
  
Sequence flows for all operational processes and contract interactions.  
  
**00_Tech Spec**  
  
Technical specification that translates Business Requirements into contract behavior.  
  
⸻  
  
**6. Implementation Layer (Henry Action Required)**  
  
**00_Henry Action Plan - Contracts.md**  
  
*(This is the NEW file that replaces “Ajustes Finais – Redeployment & Wallets”.)*  
  
**What this file contains:**  
	•	Full breakdown of which contracts must be rewritten, redeployed or redesigned  
	•	Clear functional expectations for TokenSale, Staking, Treasury, P2P Desk, Identity and Compliance modules  
	•	Invariants and constraints inherited from Tokenomics + Whitepaper  
	•	Protocol sequencing and dependency rules  
	•	Explicit list of items that *are Henry’s responsibility*  
	•	Explicit list of items *out of Henry’s scope* (multisig creation, operational wallets, custody, organizational matters)  
  
**Why this file is critical:**  
It is Henry’s operational blueprint — the document that connects conceptual design to executable development tasks.  
This is the file the dev must follow when implementing the new version of the protocol.  
  
⸻  
  
**7. Audit & Verification Layer**  
  
**03_Audit Preparation**  
  
Requirements, materials and evidence needed before external audit.  
  
**04_Verification Checklist**  
  
Internal QA to validate consistency across all layers.  
  
⸻  
  
**8. Correct Reading Order (Authoritative)**  
	1.	**01_Henry’s Q&A**  
	2.	**00_01_V3_Whitepaper Full Institutional Version**  
	3.	**00_02_V2_Whitepaper Public Edition**  
	4.	**00_04_Tokenomics Institutional Extended**  
	5.	**00_05_Tokenomics Public Edition**  
	6.	**00_Business Requirements Master Note**  
	7.	**01_Architecture Diagram Pack**  
	8.	**02_Sequence Diagram Pack**  
	9.	**00_Tech Spec**  
	10.	**00_Henry Action Plan - Contracts.md**  
	11.	**03_Audit Preparation**  
	12.	**04_Verification Checklist**  
  
⸻  
  
**9. For Henry — Practical Focus Path**  
  
Your required reading path:  
	1.	**Q&A** (context and rationale)  
	2.	**Institutional Whitepaper V3**  
	3.	**Tokenomics Institutional Extended**  
	4.	**Tech Spec**  
	5.	**Henry Action Plan** *(the new file)*  
	6.	**Architecture + Sequence Packs**  
	7.	**Verification Checklist**  
  
This ensures alignment between design → requirements → implementation → validation.  
  
⸻  
  
**10. Compliance and Safety Notes**  
  
All documents strictly follow:  
	•	MiCA utility-token criteria  
	•	FINMA guidelines  
	•	CVM 188/23  
	•	No financial promises  
	•	No representational rights over receivables or partner operations  
  
Treasury–Desk interactions are capped, controlled and explicitly **non-guarantee-forming**.  
  
Public documents must end with the DGTEnergy compliance notice.
