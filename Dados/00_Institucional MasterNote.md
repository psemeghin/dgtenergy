	•	Owner functions limited to pause/resume sale, withdraw management fees, and update wallets.  
	•	****Interim controls:**** any non-emergency change requires ≥48h pre-notice and post-action disclosure with TX hash in /data.  
	•	****Emergency pause:**** allowed only for verified security events, with disclosure within 24h.  
  
⸻  
  
03_Security & Assurance  
	•	****Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD)**** active from Day 0.  
	•	External security researcher engaged for continuous testing.  
	•	Smart contracts audited and verified on BscScan; reports published in /data.

04_Economic Model**** (Plain-English Summary)****  
  
****Whitelist (Q4 2025)****  
	•	Price: ****0.030 USDT / DGT3****.  
	•	Target: ****1 000 000 USDT (net)****.  
	•	Allocation: 50 % development (non-productive, excluded from AUM) + 50 % energy receivables under MoUs (productive, counted toward FDR).  
	•	FDR considered achieved once the energy-designated 50 % is fully deployed and disclosed in /data.  
	•	Early-bird participants receive identical staking eligibility once deployment is confirmed.  
  
****Progressive Rounds (Q4 2025 → Q2 2026)****  
	•	Linear price ladder ****0.0321 → 0.036273 USDT/DGT3****.  
	•	Each round: ≈ 517 708 USDT (GM) / 497 000 USDT (NET).  
	•	New rounds open progressively according to capital demand.  
	•	Same 96 % Treasury / 4 % Management Fee split, fully traceable in /data.  
	•	Participants benefit from transparent pricing, verifiable deployment, and exposure to real energy receivables.  
  
****Staking (Q2 2026)****  
	•	Governed by the Full Deployment Rule (FDR).  
	•	Monthly snapshot every 20th 00:00 UTC.  
	Rewards are calculated on a one-token-one-unit basis — each DGT3 token staked accrues the same on-chain 		reward per cycle, derived exclusively from verified Treasury performance. A 0.33 % monthly administrative fee is deducted automatically before each distribution, with full proof of transfer published in /data.  
	•	0.33 % administration fee over AUM deducted before distribution.  
	•	All payouts and rates published in /data.  
  
****Reinvestment (Q3–Q4 2026)****  
	•	When verified performance exceeds 1.2 %, the excess portion may be either partially reinvested or partially 		distributed as additional staking rewards, depending on the protocol’s liquidity conditions and strategic needs.  
	All decisions and allocations are executed under multisig governance and publicly disclosed in /data, with transaction 	hashes and justification for each cycle.  
	•	Verified excess redeployed into new on-chain energy receivables.  
	•	All operations disclosed with TX hashes and AUM updates in /data.  
  
  
  
05_Treasury Operations & P2P Policy  
	•	Standard routing: ****96 % Treasury / 4 % Management Fee****, executed automatically on-chain.  
	•	****AUM composition:**** only productive deployments (confirmed via FDR).  
	•	****P2P Desk (launch Q1 2026):****  
	•	KYC-gated escrow for compliant trading.  
	•	Participant price floor: no listing or trade below the next round price.  
	•	****Treasury exception:**** buyer-only discounted bids below the next round price to facilitate liquidity; Treasury never sells via /desk.  
	•	All Treasury transactions disclosed in /data with TX hash, timestamp, and pricing reference.  
	•	Mechanism supports liquidity without altering the official price ladder.  
  
  
  
06_Compliance & Legal Positioning  
	•	****Utility token:**** access to protocol features (staking, governance, reporting).  
	•	Not equity, debt, or deposit.  
	•	KYC/AML mandatory for all investor wallets.  
	•	Periodic legal review ensures jurisdictional compliance.  
	•	Risk disclosure: there are no guaranteed returns, profits, or fixed payments. On-chain rewards are functional 		outcomes of protocol participation and depend exclusively on verified energy receivable performance.  
	The DGT3 token serves as an access instrument to the DGTEnergy protocol, not as a financial or investment 			instrument.

11_Whitepaper - Core Institutional Set  
  
**DGTEnergy — Whitepaper V3 (Full Institutional Edition)**  
  
*Tone Profile: Institutional*  
*Version: Verified — October 2025*  
*Maintainer: De Goat Capital / DGTEnergy Core Team*  
  
⸻  
  
**01. Executive Overview**  
  
DGTEnergy is a **utility-token protocol** designed to provide verifiable digital access to operational and governance utilities within the real-world energy sector.  
It connects blockchain participants to **auditable energy receivables and infrastructure operations** through a transparent and compliant framework that prioritizes on-chain accountability over financial speculation.  
  
The protocol’s primary token, **DGT3**, grants access to staking, governance, and data visibility utilities inside the DGTEnergy ecosystem.  
It is **not a security token, not a financial instrument, and not an investment contract**.  
All on-chain operations are rule-based, verifiable, and fully automated by immutable smart-contract logic.  
  
DGTEnergy transforms traditional energy financing processes into **auditable, utility-based participation mechanisms**, allowing stakeholders to interact transparently with verified operational outcomes.  
  
⸻  
  
**02. Mission, Vision, and Core Principles**  
  
**Mission**  
  
To enable transparent, compliant, and verifiable participation in the operational side of the energy sector through blockchain-based access utilities.  
  
**Vision**  
  
To establish DGTEnergy as the **global reference for institutional transparency in energy operations**, where compliance, auditability, and technological precision coexist.  
  
**Core Principles**  
	•	**Transparency by Design:** everything verifiable is publicly visible.  
	•	**Utility over Speculation:** token purpose defined by access, not financial return.  
	•	**Institutional Discipline:** all materials follow professional-grade standards.  
	•	**Tech + Trust:** automation matched with regulatory assurance.  
	•	**Real-World Anchoring:** all data and results refer to tangible energy activity.  
  
⸻  
  
**03. Institutional Framework**  
  
DGTEnergy operates under **De Goat Capital AG**, a registered European entity following the **MiCA** and **FINMA** guidelines for utility tokens.  
The institutional framework ensures that all processes — governance, treasury, and audits — remain verifiable and non-discretionary.  
  
**Governance Controls**  
  
DGTEnergy is deployed initially under a **restricted Externally Owned Account (EOA)** managed by the core development team.  
This temporary phase allows controlled contract deployment, code verification, and publication of the first **Full Deployment Report (FDR)**.  
No participant funds are handled manually; all allocations follow immutable smart-contract rules.  
  
Upon completion of the Whitelist phase and first independent audit, ownership migrates to a **time-locked 2-of-3 multisignature structure**, composed of:  
	•	**Founder A** — technology and protocol security oversight;  
	•	**Founder B** — legal, compliance, and disclosure oversight;  
	•	**Institutional Signer** — an independent third-party for procedural transparency.  
  
The multisig’s authority is **strictly operational and non-discretionary**:  
	•	It may pause or resume contracts only in verified security events.  
	•	It may update authorized wallets or release predefined audit and fee transactions.  
	•	Every action requires **two of three signatures**, is subject to **timelock**, and must be **disclosed in /data** with transaction hashes and timestamps.  
  
The multisig has **no influence over Treasury investment decisions, token pricing, or staking distribution**.  
All capital flows and allocations are fully automated by contract logic, guaranteeing DGTEnergy’s classification as a **utility-token protocol**, not a managed fund or financial product.  
  
**Security and Assurance**  
  
DGTEnergy implements a **Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD)** program and continuous third-party monitoring.  
Smart contracts are verified and audited prior to activation, with public reports published in /data/security/.  
Emergency pauses follow defined thresholds, require multisig consensus, and trigger mandatory disclosure within 24 hours.

**04. Token Identity**  
  
**Token Name:** DGT3Energy  
**Ticker:** DGT3  
**Type:** Utility Token (BEP-20)  
**Network:** BNB Smart Chain (Chain ID 56)  
**Supply:** 1,000,000,000 (fixed at genesis)  
**Mint/Burn:** None  
**Transferability:** Enabled; compliant use through KYC-gated interfaces.  
  
**Smart Contracts (BNB Mainnet):**  
	•	Token → 0x4f9e03695e16ab7a9a0d5bae4db60231ae20cc62  
	•	Token Sale → 0x6a9b64d39cf2543f80c752a9670a8477c1a6db5c  
	•	USDT (BEP-20) → 0x55d398326f99059fF775485246999027B3197955  
  
**Primary Functions:**  
	1.	Access to institutional dashboards and performance data.  
	2.	Staking eligibility following Full Deployment Rule (FDR) verification.  
	3.	Participation in protocol governance (proposal and voting).  
	4.	Controlled P2P transactions within /desk (KYC-gated environment).  
	5.	Transparency through the /data registry for all treasury activity.  
  
DGT3 serves exclusively as an **access and coordination tool** for DGTEnergy utilities.  
  
⸻  
  
**05. Economic Model**  
  
DGTEnergy’s operational structure follows a transparent, non-speculative utility cycle connecting capital inflow to verified energy activity.  
  
**Stage 1 — Capital Inflow**  
  
Participants acquire DGT3 using USDT.  
Smart contracts automatically allocate **96% to the Treasury** and **4% to the Management Fee Wallet**.  
Funds never leave the chain or pass through custodial intermediaries.  
  
**Stage 2 — Deployment**  
  
The Treasury deploys received USDT into verified energy receivables (distributed generation, efficiency programs, or corporate PPAs).  
Each deployment generates a **Full Deployment Report (FDR)** published publicly in /data.  
  
**Stage 3 — Performance Tracking**  
  
Operational proceeds flow back to the Treasury in USDT.  
After independent verification, results are recorded as on-chain data and made accessible via the DApp’s dashboards.  
These records reflect protocol performance metrics, not financial yields.  
  
**Stage 4 — Reinvestment and Allocation**  
  
When verified results exceed the operational benchmark of **1.2% monthly**, excess proceeds may be:  
	•	partially reinvested into new receivables;  
	•	partially distributed as additional staking allocations; or  
	•	retained in Treasury reserves.  
The ratio is determined under multisig supervision and disclosed in /data/reinvestment.  
All operations are verified through independent audits before execution.  
No new tokens are ever minted; supply remains fixed and fully auditable.  
  
**Operational Cost Pass-Through (Extraordinary)**  
  
Valid, third-party operational costs that are **extraordinary and invoice-backed** — such as audit overruns, compliance incidents, or deployment-related expenses — follow a **controlled pass-through rule**.  
When such costs occur during a staking cycle, they proportionally reduce that cycle’s distributable pool without impacting wallet balances.  
When they occur at capital deployment, they are deducted before the net deployed value is recorded in the **Full Deployment Report (FDR)**.  
All pass-through events are fully documented, never duplicate the 0.33% administrative fee, and are disclosed publicly in /data/fdr or /data/treasury.  
These costs do not affect token supply, price, or the **one-token-one-unit** staking model.  
  
⸻  
  
**06. Treasury and Fee Policy**  
  
DGTEnergy maintains a transparent and limited fee system:  
	•	**4% Management Fee** → routed automatically at each sale.  
	•	**0.33% Administrative Fee (monthly)** → applied automatically before staking calculations to support infrastructure and auditing.  
  
The 0.33% administrative fee is calculated **only on productive capital (AUM)** — the portion of the Treasury deployed into verified energy receivables.  
Non-productive capital, such as legal or infrastructure expenditures, does not form part of the AUM base but remains transparently reported in /data/treasury.  
  
No hidden spreads, commissions, or discretionary management costs exist.  
All fees are executed on-chain and publicly traceable.  
  
⸻  
  
**07. Staking Framework**  
  
The staking process is a **utility participation mechanism**, not an investment product.  
It allows token holders to take part in monthly on-chain participation cycles based on verified operational data.  
  
**Key Parameters:**  
	•	**Distribution Asset:** USDT (BEP-20)  
	•	**Eligibility:** wallet must be staked at 00:00 UTC on the 20th of each month.  
	•	**Accrual Basis:** one-token-one-unit (equalized access).  
	•	**Lock Period:** none — unstaking removes participation for that cycle only.  
	•	**Activation:** enabled only after FDR confirmation.  
	•	**Administrative Fee:** 0.33% (automatic).  
	•	**Transparency:** every snapshot and transaction hash disclosed in /data/staking.  
  
All staking participation is determined strictly by token count (one-token-one-unit), independent of purchase phase or the Treasury’s capital composition.  
Tokens associated with non-productive allocations remain fully eligible for staking.  
This ensures neutrality among participants and preserves DGTEnergy’s classification as a **utility-token protocol**.  
  
⸻  
  
**08. Governance and Decentralization**  
  
DGTEnergy follows a **phased governance model**:  
	1.	**Launch Phase (2025):** initial control under restricted EOA.  
	2.	**Transition Phase (late 2025):** migration to 2-of-3 multisig for operational integrity.  
	3.	**DAO Phase (2027+):** progressive decentralization using Snapshot and on-chain voting.  
  
Governance decisions affect **protocol operations only**, not financial allocations.  
Token supply, pricing ladder, and fee parameters are immutable post-deployment.  
  
⸻  
  
**09. Compliance and Legal Posture**  
  
DGTEnergy operates under **Utility Token classification** per MiCA and FINMA guidelines.  
It is not a security, deposit, or investment vehicle.  
  
**Key Legal Characteristics:**  
	•	No expectation of profit or common enterprise.  
	•	No promise of repayment or dividends.  
	•	Full automation of treasury and distribution processes.  
	•	All participation requires prior KYC/AML verification.  
  
Independent legal opinions confirming utility-token status are available in /legal/.  
  
⸻  
  
**10. Transparency and Auditability**  
  
DGTEnergy’s transparency is **continuous and structural**, not declarative.  
The /data registry provides:  
	•	Treasury reports (GM, NET, fees).  
	•	Monthly staking snapshots.  
	•	Reinvestment logs and administrative fee ledgers.  
	•	Audit reports and vulnerability disclosures.  
  
Audits occur at each operational milestone and annually thereafter.  
Every contract address and audit hash is publicly verifiable.  
  
⸻  
  
**11. Roadmap Summary**  
	•	**Q4 2025:** Launch and Whitelist sale (0.030 USDT/DGT3), initial deployments, first FDR.  
	•	**Q1 2026:** Progressive rounds (0.0321 → 0.036273 USDT), /desk launch.  
	•	**Q2 2026:** Staking activation under FDR compliance.  
	•	**Q3–Q4 2026:** Reinvestment rule applied (>1.2%), first transparency audit.  
	•	**2027+:** DAO maturity, ongoing compliance, and potential EVM expansion.  
  
⸻  
  
**12. Security and Risk Disclosure**  
  
DGTEnergy employs a **defense-in-depth security architecture**:  
	•	Verified contract sources.  
	•	Reentrancy protection and pausability.  
	•	2-of-3 multisig with timelock.  
	•	Continuous vulnerability monitoring (CVD).  
	•	Public advisories for any incident or fix.  
  
Participation carries operational and regulatory risks; no guarantees of performance or valuation apply.  
DGTEnergy’s safeguards minimize — but cannot eliminate — technical or systemic risks.  
  
⸻  
  
**13. Branding and Design System**  
  
The DGTEnergy brand represents **precision, discipline, and transparency**.  
All documents and DApp visuals adhere to:  
	•	**Colors:** Petroleum Blue (#005F73), Graphite Gray (#2F3E46), White (#FAFAFA).  
	•	**Typography:** Space Grotesk (headings), Inter (body).  
	•	**Layout:** clear margins, minimal geometry, no gradients or shadows.  
	•	**Light-only mode**, AA accessibility standard.  
	•	**CTA behavior:** hover:scale-105 hover:opacity-90 transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out.  
  
Visual consistency reinforces the protocol’s institutional trust identity.  
  
⸻  
  
**14. Institutional Statement**  
  
DGTEnergy is a **technological infrastructure for verifiable participation**, not a financial product.  
It replaces speculative interpretation with operational traceability — a model of transparency for energy-sector participation through compliant, auditable design.  
  
⸻  
  
**15. Disclaimer**  
  
DGTEnergy is a **utility-token protocol**.  
Participation grants access to protocol utilities only — staking, governance, and data visibility — and does not represent equity, debt, or financial instruments.  
All allocations are performance-based, discretionary, and fully transparent on-chain.

⸻  
  
**02. Legal Classification**  
  
The DGT3 token is classified and operated as a **Utility Token** under **MiCA (EU)**, **FINMA (CH)**, and **CVM 188/23 (BR)**.  
It provides digital access to protocol utilities only — governance participation, staking eligibility, and visibility of verified operational data.  
  
DGT3 does **not** represent:  
• ownership, debt, or financial claim;  
• profit rights, returns, or interest;  
• pooled capital, investment exposure, or equity.  
  
All token functions are executed by immutable smart contracts; no discretionary intervention exists.  
  
⸻  
  
**03. Distribution Logic**  
  
DGTEnergy’s distribution model is **phase-based and on-chain**, executed through audited smart contracts with zero manual custody.  
  
**Phase 1 — Whitelist (Open)**  
  
**Price:** 0.030 USDT / DGT3  
**Target (Net to Treasury):** 1,000,000 USDT  
**Gross Collected (GM):** ≈ 1,041,667 USDT  
**Management Fee (4%):** ≈ 41,667 USDT  
**Tokens Delivered:** 34,722,222 DGT3  
**Split Logic:** 96% Treasury / 4% Management Fee Wallet (automated)  
**Delivery:** Immediate on-chain transfer to connected wallet  
  
**Deployment Rule (Whitelist-Specific):**  
The Whitelist phase is the **only stage** in which the protocol’s net proceeds (NET) are divided between productive and non-productive allocations.  
For transparency and audit compliance:  
• **50% of Whitelist NET** is directed to technical, legal, and operational infrastructure — considered **non-productive capital**, **not included in the Treasury’s AUM** but **fully eligible for staking participation** under the one-token-one-unit model;  
• **50% of Whitelist NET** is deployed into verified energy receivables — considered **productive capital**, included in AUM and directly linked to operational verification.  
  
Valid, third-party deployment costs (such as due diligence, escrow, compliance filings, or settlement fees) may be recognized as **deployment-level pass-throughs**, deducted before the net productive deployment is recorded in the corresponding /data/fdr-whitelist.json.  
  
This dual-purpose structure applies **only** to the Whitelist phase.  
All subsequent rounds deploy **100% of NET** into verified, productive energy operations.  
  
⸻  
  
**Phase 2 — Progressive Rounds (Step-Up Model)**  
  
**Number of Rounds:** 70  
**Price Range:** 0.0321 → 0.036273 USDT / DGT3 (linear increase)  
**Per-Round Treasury Target (NET):** 497,000 USDT  
**Per-Round Gross (GM):** 517,708.33 USDT  
**Management Fee (4%):** 20,708.33 USDT  
**Token Delivery:** Instant; tokens calculated at 18-decimal precision  
**Aggregate Management Fee (WL + Rounds):** ≈ 1,491,250 USDT  
  
Each round enforces its own **on-chain cap**.  
Overflow transactions revert automatically.  
All pricing and allocation rules are immutable and publicly visible in /data/rounds.  
  
⸻  
  
**04. Treasury and Fee Routing**  
  
Every transaction in the TokenSale contract follows the **immutable 96%/4% split**:  
• **96% → Treasury Wallet** — operational capital for verified deployments.  
• **4% → Management Fee Wallet** — protocol operations, audits, and compliance.  
  
No multisig or DAO can modify this rule.  
All routing events are recorded in /data/treasury.  
  
**Administrative Fee (0.33%)**  
  
A fixed administrative fee of **0.33% per month** applies to the Treasury’s **productive AUM**.  
It covers audits, infrastructure, and regulatory maintenance, deducted before each staking cycle.  
Records and hashes are published in /data/admin-fee-ledger.  
  
⸻  
  
**05. Staking Utility**  
  
Staking is a **protocol participation function**, not a financial product.  
It operates **entirely by token count (one-token-one-unit)**, providing equal access for all holders regardless of capital origin or phase.  
Non-productive capital is not part of AUM but its holders participate equally in staking.  
  
**Operational Cost Pass-Through (Extraordinary)**  
  
Valid, third-party operational costs that are **extraordinary and invoice-backed** — such as audit overruns, compliance filings, regulatory fees, or deployment-related expenses — follow a **pass-through framework** consistent with the Business Model V3.  
  
**Application Rules:**  
• When such costs occur **during a staking cycle**, they reduce that cycle’s distributable pool proportionally — no user wallet is ever debited, and all stakers remain equal per token.  
• When they occur **at capital deployment**, they are deducted **before the deployment record is finalized in the FDR**, reflected as a net deployed amount, and disclosed in /data/fdr or /data/treasury.  
• These costs never duplicate the 0.33% administrative fee, never affect token supply or pricing, and are always documented and verifiable on-chain.  
  
**Parameters:**  
  
• **Distribution Asset:** USDT (BEP-20)  
• **Eligibility Snapshot:** 20th of each month, 00:00 UTC  
• **Accrual Basis:** one-token-one-unit (equal access)  
• **Lock Period:** none  
• **Activation:** begins only after Full Deployment Report (FDR) confirmation  
• **Administrative Fee:** 0.33% (AUM-based, pre-deduction)  
• **Transparency:** all snapshots, rates, and hashes disclosed in /data/staking  
  
⸻  
  
**06. Reinvestment Policy (Final Revision)**  
  
DGTEnergy enforces a **performance-linked reinvestment model** to sustain Treasury health and transparency.  
  
• **≤ 1.2% verified monthly performance →** distributed through staking as regular participation output.  
• **Performance exceeding 1.2% →** may be **partially reinvested** into new verified receivable portfolios, **partially distributed as additional staking allocation**, or **retained as Treasury reserve**, according to audit results and liquidity planning.  
• Ratios and transactions are disclosed in /data/reinvestment.  
  
No discretionary reinvestment is possible.  
All actions follow audit validation and are publicly verifiable.  
  
⸻  
  
**07. Governance and Control**  
  
Governance structure:  
	1.	**Launch (EOA):** restricted deployer account during audit and FDR publication.  
	2.	**Transition (Q4 2025):** migration to time-locked **2-of-3 multisig** for operational oversight.  
	3.	**DAO (2027+):** limited Snapshot governance for transparency proposals only.  
  
Multisig can pause contracts, release predefined fees, or update authorized addresses.  
It cannot alter tokenomics, supply, or fee structure.  
All actions are logged in /data/governance.  
  
⸻  
  
**08. Transparency Framework**  
  
DGTEnergy maintains a public on-chain registry /data/ for audit and verification.  
  
**Key Directories:**  
• /data/fdr — Full Deployment Reports (productive capital verification)  
• /data/treasury — routing logs and balances  
• /data/staking — cycle records  
• /data/reinvestment — reinvestment ratios  
• /data/audit — independent audits  
• /data/security — CVD advisories  
  
All entries contain timestamps, TX hashes, and digital verification signatures.  
  
⸻  
  
**09. Compliance and Legal Integrity**  
  
DGTEnergy’s tokenomics meet international standards for utility tokens:  
• No profit expectation or common enterprise.  
• No discretionary capital control.  
• Fully automated routing and verification.  
• Immutable supply and fee parameters.  
• KYC/AML verification required for participation.

13_Business Model - Core Institutional Set  
**DGTEnergy — Business Model V3 (Full Institutional Edition)**  
  
*Tone Profile: Institutional*  
*Version: Verified — October 2025*  
*Maintainer: De Goat Capital / DGTEnergy Core Team*  
  
⸻  
  
**01. Institutional Overview**  
  
DGTEnergy is a **utility-token protocol** created and operated by **De Goat Capital AG**, under a European jurisdiction aligned with **MiCA** and **FINMA** standards.  
The model unites **on-chain automation**, **regulatory compliance**, and **verified energy operations**, allowing every transaction to be auditable, measurable, and legally sound.  
  
DGTEnergy is not a financial intermediary.  
It does not manage or pool user capital, nor does it promise returns or appreciation.  
Its purpose is to provide **digital access utilities** — governance, staking interface, and data visibility — for transparent participation in real-world energy operations.  
  
⸻  
  
**02. Core Concept**  
  
DGTEnergy establishes a verifiable link between blockchain infrastructure and the real energy economy through a **utility-token architecture** designed around:  
	1.	**Utility Access** — DGT3 tokens grant entry to dashboards, staking, and governance.  
	2.	**Operational Traceability** — all treasury deployments and receipts are recorded on-chain.  
	3.	**Automated Discipline** — immutable smart contracts execute all routing and fee logic.  
  
The protocol’s business model is governed by transparency, not speculation.  
  
⸻  
  
**03. Value Proposition**  
  
DGTEnergy introduces **institutional-grade transparency** to the energy sector by tokenizing the operational layer — not the asset — of verified receivables.  
Every capital movement is documented, auditable, and visible to the public.  
  
**Core Strengths:**  
	•	Verifiable link between blockchain and productive energy assets.  
	•	Immutable routing of funds and administrative fees.  
	•	100% auditable Treasury and reinvestment flow.  
	•	Compliance with global utility-token frameworks.  
	•	Institutional governance without discretionary control.  
  
⸻  
  
**04. Operational Model**  
  
**A. Structure**  
  
The protocol operates through four coordinated smart-contract systems:  
	1.	**TokenSale Contract** — receives USDT, applies 96%/4% split, issues DGT3 tokens.  
	2.	**Treasury Contract** — manages capital and performs verified productive deployments.  
	3.	**Staking Contract** — enables equal participation based on token count.  
	4.	**Data Layer (/data)** — public registry with all reports, audits, and governance logs.  
  
Each contract is audited, verified on-chain, and integrated into the DGTEnergy transparency registry.  
  
⸻  
  
**B. Phased Deployment**  
	1.	**Whitelist Phase:**  
50% of net proceeds allocated to technical, legal, and operational infrastructure (non-productive);  
50% deployed into verified productive receivables.  
Both uses documented in /data/fdr-whitelist.json.  
	2.	**Progressive Rounds:**  
Seventy rounds following the predefined step-up pricing logic.  
From this stage onward, **100% of Treasury NET** is deployed into productive capital.  
	3.	**Operational Cycles:**  
Each verified deployment generates a **Full Deployment Report (FDR)** containing timestamp, TX hash, and audit reference.  
	4.	**Staking Activation:**  
Token holders connect DGT3 to participate in verified monthly cycles, following the **one-token-one-unit** rule.  
No lockups, guaranteed rates, or profit linkage exist.  
  
⸻  
  
**05. Capital Flow Logic**  
  
Every on-chain transaction is deterministic and publicly verifiable.  
  
**Process Flow:**  
	1.	Participant sends USDT to the **TokenSale** contract.  
	2.	Contract executes **96% to Treasury / 4% to Management Fee** (automatic and immutable).  
	3.	Tokens are issued immediately to the participant’s wallet.  
	4.	Treasury deploys productive capital into verified energy receivables.  
	5.	All actions are visible in /data/treasury and /data/fdr.  
  
No manual custody, discretionary management, or off-chain interference occurs.  
  
⸻  
  
**06. Treasury Governance**  
  
DGTEnergy applies a staged control structure to ensure procedural integrity:  
	•	**Phase 1:** Deployment under a restricted **EOA** (Externally Owned Account) for initial contract and audit setup.  
	•	**Phase 2:** Migration to a **time-locked 2-of-3 multisig** (Founder A, Founder B, and Institutional Signer).  
	•	**Phase 3:** Transition to DAO oversight for transparency, without financial authority.  
  
**Multisig Powers:**  
	•	Emergency pause/resume (upon verified incident).  
	•	Predefined fee releases.  
	•	Audit and KYC vendor updates.  
  
**Multisig Limits:**  
	•	Cannot alter supply, token price, or economic parameters.  
	•	Cannot re-route funds or modify reinvestment ratios.  
  
All actions are time-locked, hashed, and published in /data/governance.  
  
⸻  
  
**07. Performance Verification**  
  
Performance within DGTEnergy is verified through immutable Full Deployment Reports (FDRs) and independent audits.  
  
**AUM Definition**  
	•	**AUM (Assets Under Measurement)** represents only **productive capital** — i.e., energy receivables with measurable and verified performance.  
	•	**Non-productive capital** (infrastructure, legal, platform development) **is excluded from AUM** but its token holders **participate equally in staking**, since staking is determined by token count, not by AUM correlation.  
	•	The **0.33% administrative fee** is calculated monthly **on AUM only** and deducted before staking-cycle computation.  
All ledgers and TX hashes are disclosed in /data/admin-fee-ledger.  
  
**Staking Neutrality**  
  
All staking participation is **uniform per token** — one-token-one-unit — regardless of when or how tokens were acquired.  
Capital origin, project type, or round phase do not alter staking eligibility or weight.  
  
⸻  
  
**Operational Cost Pass-Through (Extraordinary)**  
  
Valid, third-party operational costs that are extraordinary and invoice-backed — such as audit overruns, regulatory filings, compliance incidents, or deployment-related fees — follow a **controlled pass-through framework** that preserves transparency without creating investor-type exposure.  
  
**Rules of Application:**  
	1.	**Cycle-Level Pass-Through:**  
When recognized during an active staking cycle, such costs **reduce that cycle’s distributable pool proportionally**.  
No participant wallet is debited, and all staking outputs remain equal (one-token-one-unit).  
	2.	**Deployment-Level Pass-Through:**  
When such costs occur **at capital deployment** (e.g., due diligence, legal registration, escrow, settlement, or credit insurance), they are deducted **before recording the net deployment** in the FDR.  
These deductions appear as net deployed amounts and are disclosed with invoice and transaction proofs in /data/fdr or /data/treasury.  
They do **not affect Treasury AUM**, staking rate, or token supply.  
	3.	**General Safeguards:**  
	•	Never duplicate the 0.33% administrative fee.  
	•	Never alter token supply, pricing, or participant equality.  
	•	Must be fully documented with invoice and transaction references.  
  
**Result:**  
No receivable, asset, or cost event creates a direct link between treasury operations and individual token holders.  
Staking outputs remain uniform, automatic, and auditable.  
  
⸻  
  
**08. Revenue and Fee Framework**  
  
DGTEnergy’s operational sustainability relies on predefined, immutable on-chain fees:  
	•	**4% Management Fee:** automatically routed to protocol operations, audits, and compliance.  
	•	**0.33% Administrative Fee:** calculated monthly on productive AUM, deducted pre-staking.  
	•	**Extraordinary Pass-Throughs:** recognized only upon third-party documentation, applied at cycle or deployment level as defined above.  
  
No spreads, hidden commissions, or manual adjustments exist.  
All transfers are public and on-chain.  
  
⸻  
  
**09. Reinvestment Policy (Final Compliance Revision)**  
  
DGTEnergy applies a **flexible, performance-linked reinvestment model** ensuring the sustainability of the Treasury and equitable participation for token holders.  
	•	**≤ 1.2% verified monthly performance →** distributed through the staking mechanism as the standard participation output.  
	•	**Performance exceeding 1.2% →** may be **partially reinvested** into new verified energy operations, **partially distributed via additional staking allocation**, or **retained in Treasury reserve**, depending on liquidity and operational planning.  
	•	Ratios among reinvestment, distribution, and reserve are defined by the Treasury under multisig supervision and disclosed with TX hashes in /data/reinvestment.  
	•	No discretionary or opaque handling is allowed; every decision must follow audit confirmation and be traceable on-chain.  
  
This rule balances sustainability, transparency, and fairness while maintaining DGTEnergy’s **utility-token classification**.  
  
⸻  
  
**10. Legal Integrity and Compliance**  
  
DGTEnergy’s structure meets all criteria for **Utility Token** classification under:  
	•	**MiCA (EU)**, **FINMA (Switzerland)**, **CVM 188/23 (Brazil)**.  
	•	Tokens confer no equity, debt, or profit rights.  
	•	All utilities require prior KYC/AML verification.  
	•	Full transparency through public disclosure and CVD protocols.  
  
Independent legal opinions are available at /legal/LegalOpinions_UtilityToken.pdf.  
  
⸻  
  
**11. Transparency Framework**  
  
DGTEnergy’s /data registry operates as a **live audit layer**, including:  
	•	/data/fdr — verified deployments  
	•	/data/treasury — routing and balances  
	•	/data/staking — cycles and metrics  
	•	/data/reinvestment — ratios and decisions  
	•	/data/audit — independent reports  
	•	/data/security — vulnerability advisories  
  
All entries contain timestamps, hashes, and digital signatures for verification.  
  
⸻  
  
**12. Governance Transparency**  
  
All governance actions are logged and time-stamped.  
The multisig acts only for procedural continuity, not financial management.  
DAO governance (from 2027) will address transparency and reporting cadence exclusively.  
  
⸻  
  
**13. Risk and Responsibility**  
  
DGTEnergy acknowledges operational risks such as:  
	•	Smart-contract or blockchain malfunction.  
	•	Delays in third-party verification of receivables.  
	•	Regulatory shifts in digital-asset frameworks.  
  
Mitigation is achieved through continuous auditing, redundancy, and open data disclosure.  
No guarantee of performance or valuation is provided.  
  
⸻  
  
**14. Institutional Positioning**

**DGTEnergy — Legal Terms & Compliance V3 (Full Institutional Edition)**  
  
*Tone Profile: Institutional*  
*Version: Verified — October 2025*  
*Maintainer: De Goat Capital / DGTEnergy Core Team*  
  
⸻  
  
**01. Legal Nature and Classification**  
  
DGTEnergy operates exclusively as a **utility-token protocol**, providing participants with digital access to protocol utilities — including governance, staking functionality, and data visibility — within a fully audited, compliant blockchain environment.  
  
The **DGT3 token** is legally classified as a **Utility Token**, according to:  
	•	**MiCA (European Union):** Title II, Chapter 2 — “Asset-Referenced and Utility Tokens”;  
	•	**FINMA Guidelines (Switzerland):** FINMA ICO Framework, Category 2 — “Utility Tokens”;  
	•	**CVM Resolution 188/23 (Brazil):** “Tokens that represent rights of access, use, or utility, without characteristics of financial instruments.”  
  
**International Compliance Statement (CVM and U.S. Jurisdictions)**  
  
DGTEnergy and **De Goat Capital AG** operate under **Utility Token classification** and maintain strict adherence to global regulatory frameworks.  
  
**Under Brazilian Law (CVM 188/23):**  
DGT3 does **not** qualify as a security or collective investment contract.  
It grants access exclusively to **digital utilities** — governance, staking, and data transparency — without creating financial exposure or shared profit expectation.  
DGTEnergy performs no capital management or fiduciary function and holds no discretionary control over participants’ funds.  
  
**Under U.S. Law (SEC, CFTC, and FinCEN):**  
DGTEnergy confirms that the DGT3 token does **not** constitute a security, commodity, or money service under U.S. regulatory definitions.  
Following the **Howey Test** criteria:  
	•	There is **no investment of money** expecting profit from others’ efforts.  
	•	There is **no common enterprise** or capital pooling.  
	•	There is **no expectation of profit**, only access to verifiable operational data.  
	•	There is **no managerial reliance**, as all flows are automated by smart contracts.  
  
Accordingly, DGT3 is **not subject to the Securities Act of 1933**, the **Securities Exchange Act of 1934**, or **CFTC** jurisdiction.  
DGTEnergy does **not offer or promote participation** to U.S. persons or entities, nor to jurisdictions where such activity could be construed as an offer of securities.  
KYC and geofencing protocols are implemented to maintain full jurisdictional segregation and compliance.  
  
**Exclusion of Financial Qualification**  
  
DGT3 does **not** represent:  
	•	ownership, debt, or equity in any entity;  
	•	revenue participation, profit rights, or dividends;  
	•	pooled or managed capital;  
	•	financial, credit, or investment instruments.  
  
DGTEnergy and De Goat Capital AG do not perform any investment management, brokerage, or custody activity.  
All utilities are provided under the principle of **transparency and equal access**, without discretionary control.  
  
⸻  
  
**02. Governing Jurisdiction and Applicable Law**  
  
DGTEnergy is administered under the legal structure of **De Goat Capital AG**, domiciled in a European jurisdiction compliant with **MiCA** and **FINMA** standards.  
Applicable law is determined by the jurisdiction of incorporation and by the international legal instruments recognized under **Swiss and EU regulatory equivalence**.  
  
The project observes a **“jurisdictional parity” principle**, ensuring that every operation executed on-chain also aligns with the most restrictive legal interpretation across its active regions of operation.  
  
⸻  
  
**03. Regulatory Compliance Framework**  
  
DGTEnergy’s compliance architecture is designed to meet or exceed global standards for **AML/KYC**, **CFT**, **data protection**, and **market integrity**.  
  
**3.1. KYC/AML Verification**  
  
All participants must undergo verification consistent with **FATF**, **MiCA**, and **CVM** guidelines:  
	•	Identity verification via regulated service providers.  
	•	Screening against global sanctions and PEP lists.  
	•	On-chain monitoring using blockchain analytics.  
  
DGTEnergy does not accept anonymous or privacy-shielded transactions (mixers, tumblers, or privacy coins).  
  
**3.2. Data Protection and Privacy**  
  
Personal data is processed exclusively for compliance and transparency purposes, under **GDPR** and **Swiss FADP** standards.  
DGTEnergy does not store or monetize user data.  
KYC results are represented only by cryptographic verification proofs, never by plain data storage.  
  
⸻  
  
**04. Tokenholder Rights and Limitations**  
  
**4.1. Access Utilities**  
  
DGT3 holders receive digital access to:  
	•	Staking interface and participation dashboards.  
	•	Governance portals (proposal and voting rights).  
	•	The /data registry with verified operational reports.  
  
These rights are **utility-based and non-financial**.  
  
**4.2. Limitations of Entitlement**  
  
DGT3 ownership does not confer:  
	•	ownership or control of Treasury resources;  
	•	entitlement to profits, yields, or interest;  
	•	participation in discretionary investment decisions.  
  
DGTEnergy’s smart contracts autonomously manage routing and verification.  
Governance rights are procedural and transparency-oriented, not financial.  
  
⸻  
  
**05. Governance and Oversight**  
  
DGTEnergy’s governance follows the **Operational Transparency Model (OTM)**.  
  
**5.1. Governance Phases**  
	1.	**Launch:** restricted EOA deployment under core team custody for audits.  
	2.	**Transition:** migration to time-locked 2-of-3 multisig for operational oversight.  
	3.	**DAO (2027+):** limited Snapshot voting for transparency evolution.  
  
**5.2. Multisig Oversight**  
  
The multisig acts as a procedural safeguard, not a management body.  
Permitted actions include:  
	•	pause/resume protocols in verified emergencies;  
	•	release of predefined audit or legal fees;  
	•	updating of authorized vendor wallets.  
  
Every multisig action is disclosed in /data/governance with timestamp and TX hash.  
  
⸻  
  
**06. Treasury, Fees, and Operational Pass-Through**  
  
DGTEnergy’s Treasury logic is immutable and fully auditable.  
  
**6.1. Fee Structure**  
	•	**Management Fee (4%)** — allocated to operations, audits, and compliance.  
	•	**Administrative Fee (0.33%)** — applied monthly to productive capital (AUM).  
	•	**Extraordinary Operational Pass-Throughs** — invoice-backed third-party events (audit, compliance, deployment).  
  
**6.2. Operational Pass-Through Logic**  
	•	Costs are deducted from the protocol’s distributable pool, **never from participant wallets**.  
	•	They are **non-recurring**, **documented**, and **published in /data/fdr or /data/treasury**.  
	•	No duplication of administrative or management fees is permitted.  
  
This framework guarantees **accounting transparency** and preserves utility-token classification.  
  
⸻  
  
**07. Reinvestment and Performance Policy**  
  
DGTEnergy applies a **performance-linked reinvestment system**:  
	•	≤ 1.2% verified monthly result → distributed via staking output.  
	•	1.2% verified → may be reinvested, distributed as additional staking, or reserved.  
	•	Ratios and TX references are made public in /data/reinvestment.
