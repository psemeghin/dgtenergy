# Branding V3  
  
*A transparent, disciplined, and globally trusted identity for decentralized energy finance.*  
  
⸻  
##   
## 01_Brand Essence  
  
Parent Company: De Goat Capital  
Project / Token: DGT-Energy (“DGT3Energy”)  
Ticker: DGT3  
Nature: Utility Token — pure access and participation; not equity, debt, or a financial instrument.  
Network: BNB Smart Chain (BEP-20)  
Supply: 1 billion — fixed and fully minted at genesis.  
  
Mission  
  
Connect blockchain participants with verified energy ecosystem utilities, enabling transparent on-chain access, governance, and data.  
  
Vision  
  
Become the global benchmark for transparent energy participation — where institutional discipline meets decentralized infrastructure.  
  
Core Promise  
  
100% of treasury capital (excluding the clearly defined 4% management fee) is allocated to real, verified energy operations — no hidden fees, no intermediaries, full on-chain traceability.  
This allocation references operational activity and does not constitute financial backing or a promise of returns.  
  
Brand DNA  
Institutional · Transparent · Energy-Driven · Technological · Compliant.  
  
  
## 02_Brand Pillars  
  
DGT-Energy is built on five foundational pillars.  
Each pillar defines how the brand communicates, behaves, and earns trust — both visually and operationally.  
  
  
	1.	Transparency by Design  
  
Every part of the ecosystem — from the DApp to public documents — must reflect traceability and clarity.  
Transparency is not a feature; it is the visual and ethical foundation of the brand.  
Design Principle: what can be verified must be visible.  
  
  
	2.	Utility over Speculation  
  
The token’s purpose lies in access and functionality, not in market hype or financial promises.  
DGT-Energy communicates utility, governance, and data access — never “profit” or “investment.”  
Tone Principle: speak in purpose, not in promises.  
  
  
	3.	Institutional Discipline  
  
The entire brand — from wording to typography — follows corporate-grade order and precision.  
Every visual decision should express operational credibility and procedural rigor.  
Design Principle: clean structure, controlled rhythm, professional balance.  
  
  
	4.	Tech + Trust  
  
Technology and credibility coexist as one concept.  
Innovation is measured, automated, and verifiable.  
Design Principle: geometry, balance, and precision signal reliability.  
  
  
	5.	Real-World Anchoring  
  
Everything the brand communicates must point back to real energy operations and tangible activity.  
No abstraction, no theory — only visible connections to measurable operations and on-chain records.  
Design Principle: always link digital access to verifiable outcomes.  
  
  
  
Summary  
  
These five pillars form the moral and visual backbone of DGT-Energy:  
→ Transparent by nature  
→ Useful by design  
→ Disciplined by structure  
→ Trusted through technology  
→ Grounded in real energy activity

## 04_Visual Identity System  
  
The DGT-Energy visual identity reflects the protocol’s character —  
**institutional, minimal, and technologically disciplined.**  
Every visual element must convey clarity, trust, and energy.  
  
  
**4.1 Color Palette (Refined and Simplified)**  
  
**Core Colors:**  
	•	**Primary — Petroleum Blue (#005F73)**  
Represents energy, confidence, and institutional depth.  
Used for titles, buttons, highlights, and hero elements.  
	•	**Background — Neutral White (#FAFAFA)**  
Represents transparency and clarity.  
Used as the global light base; dark mode is not permitted.  
	•	**Text — Graphite Gray (#2F3E46)**  
Represents professionalism and data precision.  
Used for all headings, paragraphs, and neutral text.  
  
**Usage Rules:**  
	•	These three colors define the entire system.  
	•	Shades or tints can be derived, but no external colors may be introduced.  
	•	Maintain high contrast (AA or higher accessibility).  
	•	Avoid gradients, shadows, or dark backgrounds — the identity must always feel light, precise, and open.  
	•	White is the foundation of *Transparency by Design*.  
  
  
**4.2 Typography**  
  
**Primary Typeface: Space Grotesk (Bold)**  
	•	Used for headlines, CTAs, and hero statements.  
	•	Expresses strength, confidence, and technical clarity.  
	•	Minimum size for headers: 24px.  
  
**Secondary Typeface: Inter (Regular / Medium)**  
	•	Used for paragraphs, body copy, and all interface text.  
	•	Balanced and easy to read on all devices.  
	•	Base size: 16px; line spacing 1.6x.  
  
**Formatting Principles:**  
	•	Use generous spacing and a clear typographic rhythm.  
	•	Uppercase for section titles and navigation items.  
	•	Maintain consistent type hierarchy across DApp, PDFs, and decks.  
	•	Typography should never be decorative — it must *inform and organize.*  
  
  
**4.3 Logo System**  
  
**Files:**  
	•	logo-icon.svg → standalone icon version.  
	•	logo-full.svg → logotype (wordmark) version.  
  
**Design Concept:**  
A geometric mark inspired by the flow of energy — stable, circular, and directional.  
Symbolizes the connection between blockchain capital and real-world assets.  
  
**Behavior and Usage:**  
	•	The icon version is always visible in the DApp header and on all pages.  
	•	The full logotype fades softly on scroll for a clean, responsive effect.  
	•	Always use flat design — no gradients, shadows, or effects.  
	•	Maintain clear space around the logo (at least one “D” height).  
	•	Monochrome variants can be used for special applications (print or emboss).  
  
**Visual Character:**  
Minimal, geometric, and mathematically aligned.  
The logo is not ornamental — it is a symbol of *trust and discipline.*  
  
  
**4.4 Iconography**  
  
**Format:** SVG only — scalable, flat, and pixel-perfect.  
**Color:** Petroleum Blue (#005F73) on transparent background.  
**Structure:** circular base, centered symbol occupying roughly 70% of the space.  
  
**Naming Convention:**  
Files follow this standard → icon-[name].svg  
Example: icon-wallet.svg, icon-staking.svg, icon-governance.svg.  
  
**Core Set of Icons:**  
	•	Wallet  
	•	Governance  
	•	Staking  
	•	Treasury  
	•	Transparency  
	•	Energy  
	•	Shield (Security)  
	•	Trade (P2P)  
  
**Usage Rules:**  
	•	Icons are functional — never decorative.  
	•	They express concepts like trust, control, and real-world grounding.  
	•	Use consistent stroke weight and spacing across all icons.  
	•	Avoid fills, gradients, or shadows — simplicity equals credibility.  
	•	All icons must feel balanced, circular, and geometric.  
  
**Design Principle:**  
Icons are the micro-language of the brand.  
They translate the institutional tone of DGT-Energy into *visual precision.*  
  
  
**4.5 Visual Behavior and Layout**  
  
**Header:**  
Sticky, transparent, and smoothly compresses on scroll.  
Icon always visible; logotype fades out gracefully.  
  
**Hero Section:**  
Uses Earth-at-night imagery (earth-lights.webm) to represent global energy and digital capital flows.  
Video loop must be subtle, slow, and seamless — no strong saturation or abrupt motion.  
  
**Cards and Components:**  
Rounded corners (rounded-2xl), soft shadows, generous padding.  
Animations only via opacity and scale transitions.  
Interactivity must feel sophisticated, not playful.  
  
**CTAs (Buttons):**  
hover:scale-105 hover:opacity-90 transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out  
This combination creates fluid motion — refined, not exaggerated.  
  
**Footer:**  
Includes links to institutional materials (Whitepaper, Legal Terms, Governance, Telegram, Discord, X).  
Visual tone: calm, white background, blue links.  
  
  
**Summary**  
  
The DGT-Energy visual system reflects **discipline, precision, and clarity.**  
Its power comes not from decoration, but from restraint.  
The use of petroleum blue, structured typography, and clean geometry ensures that every element   
from a wallet icon to a PDF header — speaks the same language of **institutional transparency.**
