**DGTEnergy — Business Model V3 **  
  
⸻  
  
01_Business Model Overview  
  
DGTEnergy operates as a **hybrid Web3 protocol** bridging tokenized capital with verified energy receivables in the real economy.  
Its business model is founded on **transparent value creation** — every transaction, deployment, and fee is verifiable on-chain.  
Each DGT3 token provides access to the protocol’s ecosystem and proportional participation in the verified performance of energy-backed operations.  
  
The model ensures that:  
	•	100% of net raised capital is allocated to productive energy deployments (exception for Whitelist Phase).  
	•	On-chain rewards derive solely from verified receivable performance.  
	•	Reinvestments strengthen the capital base without speculative or inflationary effects.

02_Value Proposition  
  
DGTEnergy connects global capital with the tangible productivity of the energy sector.  
It delivers value through three pillars:  
	•	**Access:** enables digital entry into real-world energy assets (receivables, PPAs, efficiency contracts).  
	•	**Transparency:** all Treasury operations, fees, staking, and reinvestments are logged on-chain in /data.  
	•	**Sustainability:** verified energy returns are recycled through reinvestment or strategic token acquisition, maintaining circular growth.  
  
DGTEnergy thus combines **blockchain efficiency with real-world impact**, enabling compliant, verifiable participation in energy financing.  
  
  
  
03_Capital Flow Architecture  
  
DGTEnergy’s operational loop follows four verifiable stages:  
  
**Stage 1 — Capital Inflow (Token Sale)**  
Investors acquire DGT3 using USDT.  
Smart contracts automatically allocate funds: **96% to Treasury**, **4% to the Management Fee Wallet**.  
The 4% fee funds operations and remains outside Treasury accounting (non-AUM).  
  
**Stage 2 — Deployment (Energy Receivables)**  
The Treasury deploys funds into verified energy receivables such as distributed generation, efficiency projects, or corporate PPAs.  
Each deployment generates a **Full Deployment Report (FDR)** with transaction hashes and references published in /data.  
  
**Stage 3 — Performance & Rewards**  
Receivable payments return to the Treasury in USDT.  
After verification, performance proceeds are allocated to the staking pool as **on-chain rewards derived from verified energy performance**, net of the 0.33% monthly administrative fee.  
Every cycle is publicly recorded with proof-of-transfer.  
  
**Stage 4 — Distribution & Reinvestment**  
Stakers receive proportional rewards based solely on the number of DGT3 tokens staked at each snapshot, ensuring equal reward per token.  
When monthly verified performance exceeds 1.2%, the excess portion may be either partially reinvested or partially distributed as additional on-chain staking rewards, depending on the protocol’s liquidity conditions and strategic needs.  
The Treasury, under multisig governance, determines the allocation ratio for each cycle and discloses it publicly in /data, including transaction hashes and rationale. This flexible policy preserves capital integrity and allows the protocol to reinforce Treasury reserves or enhance staking outcomes as needed.  
  
All reinvestments are traceable and disclosed, ensuring they reinforce productive value rather than speculative demand.  
  
  
  
04_Revenue Model and Fee Policy  
  
DGTEnergy’s sustainability relies on transparent, limited, and on-chain verifiable fees:  
	•	**Management Fee (4%)**  
Automatically routed to the Management Wallet at each token sale.  
Funds governance, audits, and operational maintenance.  
Excluded from AUM and Treasury metrics.  
	•	**Administrative Fee (0.33% per month on AUM)**  
Deducted automatically before reward distribution.  
Covers infrastructure, security, and protocol operations.  
Recorded and auditable in /data.  
  
No hidden spread, markup, or performance commission exists — ensuring full compliance and investor fairness.  
  
  
  
05_Stakeholders and Incentive Alignment  
  
DGTEnergy aligns all participants under a single principle: **value originates from verified production, not speculation.**  
	•	**Token Holders:** provide USDT capital and may stake to receive on-chain rewards from verified energy performance.  
	•	**Treasury (Protocol):** manages productive capital and ensures capital rotation and stability.  
	•	**De Goat Capital (Management):** receives the 4% operational fee; maintains governance and compliance.  
	•	**Energy Partners:** originate receivable contracts and gain early liquidity for productive use.  
	•	**Auditors / Validators:** independently verify deployments, FDRs, and distributions, strengthening accountability.  
  
This structure harmonizes incentives across all stakeholders, preserving integrity and transparency.  
  
  
  
06_Staking Framework and Reinvestment Logic  
  
The staking framework distributes rewards based exclusively on **verified Treasury performance**.  
	•	**Eligibility:** all DGT3 holders may stake once their sale phase’s deployment achieves FDR confirmation.  
	•	**Distribution:** rewards are calculated on a one-token-one-unit basis — each DGT3 token staked accrues the same on-chain reward per cycle, derived from verified Treasury performance and net of the 0.33% administrative fee.  
	•	**Cycle:** snapshots occur monthly on the 20th at 00:00 UTC.  
	•	**Priority:** distributions precede any reinvestment allocation.  
	•	**Transparency:** all staking events, snapshots, and TX hashes are recorded in /data → staking.  
  
**Reinvestment Mechanics:**  
The Reinvestment Reserve acts as a liquidity stabilizer and growth engine.  
If the monthly performance exceeds 1.2%, the excess capital is reinvested either by:  
	•	deploying into new receivables (productive reinvestment), or  
	•	acquiring DGT3 tokens directly from the market (strategic reinvestment).  
  
Both operations are disclosed in /data, executed by the Treasury, and adhere to FDR verification, ensuring **zero price manipulation and full auditability.**  
  
  
  
07_Compliance and Governance Integrity  
  
DGTEnergy’s structure ensures legal robustness under the **utility token** framework:  
	•	On-chain proof of all Treasury and fee operations.  
	•	Segregated management wallet for operational income.  
	•	Transparent reporting of every administrative deduction.  
	•	No profit or repayment obligation; rewards depend solely on verified receivable performance.  
	•	/desk governed by KYC/AML and price-floor rules; Treasury-only buyer exception maintains liquidity discipline.  
	•	Independent third-party audits validate both contract logic and financial flows.  
  
This framework ensures DGTEnergy remains compliant, transparent, and auditable under global utility-token standards.  
  
  
  
08_Long-Term Sustainability  
  
DGTEnergy’s business model sustains itself through a transparent, recurring cycle:  
	1.	Token sale funds are deployed into real, income-generating energy assets.  
	2.	Energy receivables generate measurable returns.  
	3.	Returns feed the staking pool as verifiable on-chain rewards.  
			4.	Excess capital may trigger either reinvestment or additional staking distributions — both auditable on-			chain — compounding long-term token utility and Treasury strength.”  
Each step is designed to ensure **capital integrity, on-chain proof, and long-term alignment between token utility and real-world productivity.**  
  
  
  
09_Audit Scope  
  
All smart contracts, Treasury transactions, and fee ledgers are fully verifiable via the /data registry.  
Independent third-party auditors are authorized to review:  
	•	contract source and deployment hashes;  
	•	management and Treasury wallet activity;  
	•	FDR and staking distribution proofs;  
	•	and reinvestment transaction records.  
  
This scope guarantees continuous transparency and institutional-grade auditability.
