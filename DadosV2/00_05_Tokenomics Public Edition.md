# 00_05_Tokenomics Public Edition  
  
Perfeito.  
Vou te entregar agora a **versão oficial**, em inglês, **“Tokenomics Public Edition — DGT3 (DGTEnergy)”**, totalmente alinhada ao Branding V3 e 100% compliance-safe, mas muito mais simples, comercial, clara e digerível.  
  
Esta versão substitui a complexidade técnica por uma narrativa institucional e acessível.  
E não altera nenhuma regra econômica do protocolo.

**00. Executive Summary**  
  
DGTEnergy introduces **DGT3**, a fixed-supply utility token that provides transparent and compliant access to real energy operations.  
The protocol connects participants to verifiable operational data through a neutral, automated architecture with no financial rights, no expectations of performance and no exposure to investment-like characteristics.  
  
DGT3 grants access to protocol utilities — participation, governance visibility and operational transparency — while ensuring full alignment with MiCA, FINMA and CVM 188/23 guidance.  
  
Everything inside the protocol is automated, rule-based and fully traceable on-chain.  
  
⸻  
  
**01. Why DGT3 Exists**  
  
Energy operations are traditionally opaque and restricted to institutional participants.  
DGTEnergy creates a transparent, compliance-aligned path for individuals and institutions to access operational tools and verified data — without creating financial instruments.  
  
The protocol does **not** share revenue, dividends, ownership or financial outcomes.  
Instead, it offers **regulated utility access** to a real operational environment.  
  
⸻  
  
**02. Token Identity**  
  
**Name:** DGT3Energy  
**Ticker:** DGT3  
**Type:** Utility token  
**Network:** BNB Smart Chain (BEP-20)  
**Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000 (fixed, fully minted at genesis)  
**Mint / Burn:** None  
**Transferability:** Enabled; secondary activity restricted to the KYC-gated P2P Desk  
**Compliance:** MiCA-aligned utility token; not a financial instrument  
  
DGT3 does not confer:  
– equity  
– debt  
– repayment  
– dividends  
– profit rights  
– exposure to receivables  
  
All participation is strictly utility-based.  
  
⸻  
  
**03. Utility Model (Simplified Framework)**  
  
The DGT3 token enables access to protocol tools across **three utility layers**:  
  
**A) Access Utility**  
  
Grants entry to operational dashboards, deployment visibility and system-level parameters.  
  
**B) Participation Utility**  
  
Allows users to take part in monthly operational cycles once eligibility conditions are met.  
Participation is optional, non-financial and does not guarantee any operational outcome.  
  
**C) Transparency Utility**  
  
Provides visibility into treasury activity, operational cycles, verified data flows and protocol metrics.  
  
**Important:**  
The token does not promise nor imply financial benefits.  
It simply enables access to protocol functionalities.  
  
⸻  
  
**04. How the Protocol Works (Commercial Overview)**  
  
DGTEnergy operates through a clear and predictable process:  
  
**1) USDT enters the protocol via the token sale.**  
  
A predefined portion is routed to the treasury under automated rules.  
  
**2) The treasury deploys capital into verified energy operations.**  
  
Only pre-audited partners are eligible.  
  
**3) Operational cycles occur monthly.**  
  
Partners return verified operational data to the protocol.  
  
**4) Eligible participants access the cycle results through the Participation Utility.**  
  
This process does not create rights to returns or financial expectations.  
  
**5) All activity is fully recorded on-chain.**  
  
Users see a simplified dashboard; detailed registries remain available for audit.  
  
**Public view:**  
A clean, simple dashboard summarizing:  
	•	Treasury Activity  
	•	Operational Deployments  
	•	Monthly Cycle Data  
	•	Participation Status  
  
**Detailed audit view:**  
Available for partners, auditors and institutional users.  
  
⸻  
  
**05. Distribution Framework**  
  
DGT3 follows a transparent and deterministic distribution model across three phases:  
  
**A) Whitelist Phase (0.030 USDT per DGT3)**  
  
Reserved access under compliance review, with structured allocation rules.  
  
**B) Progressive Rounds (0.0321 → 0.036273 USDT per DGT3)**  
  
Seventy rounds executed with a fixed price ladder and deterministic supply allocation.  
  
**C) Full Allocation**  
  
All 1B tokens allocated through transparent, rule-based cycles.  
  
The price ladder and total supply are immutable.  
  
⸻  
  
**06. Participation Framework (Simplified)**  
  
Participation allows DGT3 holders to engage with operational cycles.  
  
**Rules:**  
– Tokens must be staked before the monthly eligibility snapshot.  
– There is no lock-in period.  
– Participation is optional and does not guarantee outcomes.  
– Only verified operational cycles enable participation access.  
  
**Participation is a utility function — not an investment mechanism.**  
  
⸻  
  
**07. Transparency Architecture**  
  
DGTEnergy publishes all operational information through the **DGTEnergy Data Portal**, including:  
	•	Treasury movements  
	•	Deployment events  
	•	Operational cycle confirmations  
	•	Participation statistics  
	•	Fee routing  
	•	Reinvestment events  
  
All items are verifiable on-chain through a unified audit registry.  
  
TX hashes exist for every step — but are shown only in the institutional/audit view for clarity.  
  
⸻  
  
**08. Governance Structure**  
  
DGTEnergy follows a tiered governance model:  
  
**A) Immutable parameters**  
  
These cannot be changed by governance:  
	•	total supply  
	•	price ladder  
	•	distribution formulas  
	•	participation rules  
	•	transparency framework  
  
**B) Governance-influenced parameters**  
  
Non-economic matters:  
	•	reporting frequency  
	•	transparency standards  
	•	dashboard improvements  
	•	service integrations  
  
**C) Execution**  
  
Operations run under a time-locked multisig structure with strict, transparent scope.  
  
⸻  
  
**09. Compliance & Legal Positioning**  
  
DGT3 is designed to remain fully aligned with MiCA, FINMA and CVM 188/23 guidelines.  
  
**The token is not:**  
– an investment  
– a security  
– a financial product  
– a representation of receivables  
– a source of any financial expectation  
  
**The token is:**  
A regulated utility asset granting access to tools, systems, dashboards and operational transparency.  
  
DGTEnergy publishes legal opinions and compliance statements at each major milestone.  
  
⸻  
  
**10. Institutional Disclaimer**  
  
DGTEnergy is a utility-token protocol.  
Participation grants access to protocol utilities only — staking, governance, and data visibility — and does not represent equity, debt, or financial instruments.  
All allocations are performance-based, discretionary, and fully transparent on-chain.  
No distributions are guaranteed.  
No financial rights or expectations are created.  
All activity is executed through automated smart contracts within an audit-ready architecture.
