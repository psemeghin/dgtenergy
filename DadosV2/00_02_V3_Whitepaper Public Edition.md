**1.Executive Summary**  
  
Brazil is entering the largest retail-energy opening in the world. With MP 1304/25, more than 90 million consumers will be able to choose their electricity provider, creating an annual opportunity estimated between 10 and 15 billion dollars in consumer migration, energy-financing demand and real operational flows. DGTEnergy was created to give participants structured access to these real-world operations through a simple mechanism: staking the DGT3 utility token.

The operational foundation of the protocol is already active. Billi, DGTEnergy’s first integrated partner, operates a validated consumer energy-financing engine backed by CCEE settlement, with more than two years of measurable activity and delinquency levels consistently near one and a half percent. These are real consumers, real energy bills and real receivables processed under a regulatory structure known for stability and predictable behavior.

Billi also illustrates how real operational flows enter the protocol. Most Brazilian consumers still purchase electricity in the regulated Captive Market, where prices are fixed and often higher. Billi supports their migration to the Free Market, where energy can be purchased at lower, negotiated rates. During this transition, consumers secure a cheaper energy price for future consumption. Billi advances the value of this future discount upfront, allowing households and businesses to benefit immediately while the migration is being processed. This advance becomes operationally viable through the structured environment that DGTEnergy provides, which connects participants to verified real-world cycles and allows these operational flows to be organized and sustained. The financed portion is later recovered through regulated monthly settlements handled by the CCEE, generating a stable and recurring receivable stream that forms the base for DGTEnergy’s monthly cycles.

DGTEnergy transforms these verified energy-financing flows into predictable monthly coordination cycles. Participants who stake DGT3 activate their position inside this environment and gain access to cycle data, partner performance and treasury activity. When an operational cycle performs, the protocol may generate functional outputs that reflect the verified performance window. In mature energy-financing environments, annualized operational behavior often ranges around 13 to 20 percent depending on market conditions, although outcomes are never guaranteed.

DGTEnergy launches from Brazil because it is the most advanced and scalable environment for consumer migration and structured energy-financing activity. Yet the architecture is global. Any partner with verifiable real-world energy operations can integrate into the protocol, enabling expansion into other regulated markets and multiplying the scale of the opportunity.

DGT3 is the access key to this environment.
Real-world operations are the foundation.
Monthly cycles are the engine that connects participants to the heart of the transition.

**2. Context and Opportunity**  
  
**2.1 Brazil’s Transformational Energy Moment**  
  
Brazil is entering one of the most significant shifts in its modern energy history. Beginning in 2026, more than ninety million consumers will gain the right to choose their electricity provider. This change transforms an essential service into an open market and creates one of the largest retail energy opportunities in the world.  
  
Such a turning point demands more than technology. It demands visibility, discipline and trust. It requires an infrastructure that can make real operations understandable and auditable at scale. Most importantly, it requires a coordination layer capable of standardizing how operational activity is interpreted and how verified results are observed.  
  
This is the space DGTEnergy occupies.  
  
**2.2 Market Operators and the Transparency Gap**  
  
Brazil’s energy transition is powered by a complex network of private operators. Among them are electricity retailers, generators, traders, originators, fintechs and consumer financing platforms. These entities execute real operational flows, issue receivables, settle transactions through CCEE processes and support the migration of consumers.  
  
Yet the market shares a structural limitation. Operational data is fragmented, inconsistent and often inaccessible to participants who are not inside the private ecosystem. There is no unified transparency layer, no verifiable record and no institutional interface through which global participants can engage with real energy financing activity.  
  
This gap is not a technical failure. It is an infrastructural one.  
  
**2.3 Why a Protocol Matters**  
  
DGTEnergy does not compete with market operators. It does not replace them or attempt to replicate their role. Instead, it provides the transparent infrastructure that was missing. The protocol creates a unified environment where verified operational activity becomes clear, structured and accessible.  
  
Through deterministic rules, the DGTEnergy coordination layer connects participants to real cycles of energy financing. It organizes information, enforces accountability and elevates the operational rigor of the ecosystem.  
  
One protocol. One token. One transparent coordination layer for real energy operations.  
  
⸻  
  
**3. What DGTEnergy Does**  
  
DGTEnergy connects participants to **real-world energy operations**. It takes the activity that already happens in the energy market — such as consumer migration, regulated receivables, and monthly settlements — and organizes it into predictable monthly cycles accessible through the DGT3 utility token.  
  
**3.1 Structured Access to Real Operational Data**  
  
Participants acquire DGT3 in the DGTEnergy DApp.  
Staking DGT3 activates access to the protocol’s operational environment, where users can observe:  
  
• monthly operational cycles  
• partner performance  
• treasury movements  
• deployment and settlement behavior  
  
DGTEnergy transforms the day-to-day operations of the energy-financing market into a structured, intelligible environment. It gives participants a view of how the market behaves across real consumer activities and regulated settlement cycles.  
  
**3.2 Participation Through Staking**  
  
Staking is how participants enter these monthly operational cycles.  
  
By staking DGT3, the participant becomes part of the coordination layer and gains expanded visibility into each cycle’s operational data, partner behavior, and monthly results.  
  
When an operational cycle performs, the protocol may generate functional outputs aligned with that performance window. These outputs reflect the behavior of the underlying real-world operation.  
Historical performance in mature energy-financing environments often ranges around 13 to 20 percent annually, depending on operational patterns, and the protocol mirrors this behavior through verified cycles.  
  
**3.3 Deterministic Monthly Cycles**  
  
Once capital is deployed, verified operational partners — such as Billi — run real consumer energy-financing operations.  
Their receivables settle monthly through regulated infrastructure, and the results of these settlements return to the protocol.  
  
DGTEnergy processes these verified results and transforms them into a coordinated operational cycle.  
Each cycle is built on:  
  
• real receivables  
• real settlement events  
• real operational behavior  
  
This creates a predictable, rule-based monthly engine aligned with the natural rhythm of the energy market.  
  
  
**3.4 DGT3 as the Access Layer**  
  
DGT3 is the access key to real operational cycles.  
It enables participants to engage directly with the protocol’s monthly coordination engine and the real-world energy activity behind it.  
  
The operational data comes from verified partners.  
The protocol structures this data.  
The participant connects to it through DGT3.  
  
DGTEnergy acts as the bridge between the user and the real operational activity of the energy transition.

**5. How the Protocol Works**  
  
DGTEnergy follows a deterministic and rule based workflow that ensures transparency and structural discipline.  
  
**5.1 Acquisition**  
  
Participants acquire DGT3 through the Whitelist or public rounds. The sale contract automatically routes ninety six percent to the Treasury and four percent to the Management Fee Safe.  
  
**5.2 Activation**  
  
Participants may stake their DGT3 at any time. Staking is optional and creates no lock period or financial obligation.  
  
**5.3 Deployment and Verification**  
  
The Treasury deploys capital to operational partners under predefined rules. Partners generate receivables, settle them through regulated market processes and return verified operational results.  
  
**5.4 Transparency**  
  
The protocol publishes verified operational data in real time. Staked participants gain complete access to cycle level visibility.  
  
**5.5 Exit Path**  
  
Participants may sell or transfer tokens through the DGTEnergy P2P Desk under KYC requirements. All transfers occur via escrow settlement. There is no redemption mechanism and no financial obligation from the protocol.  
  
⸻  
  
**6. Distribution Structure**  
  
**6.1 Whitelist**  
  
Participants may acquire DGT3 at 0.030 USDT during the whitelist phase. This phase establishes the initial treasury base and prepares the operational environment.  
  
**6.2 Public Rounds**  
  
Seventy deterministic rounds distribute the remaining supply in accordance with the protocol’s pricing ladder. Rules are transparent and fully on chain.  
  
**6.3 Secondary Activity**  
  
Secondary activity occurs exclusively through the DGTEnergy P2P Desk.  
  
KYC required  
Escrow settlement  
No market making or centralized liquidity  
Treasury may act as a buyer within defined limits for operational integrity  
  
⸻  
  
**7. Governance and Transparency**  
  
DGTEnergy adopts a progressive governance model that separates immutable economic rules from flexible transparency standards.  
  
Immutable rules include supply, staking logic, price ladder, reinvestment rules and operational cycle logic.  
  
Governance processes may influence non financial parameters including transparency reporting cadence, partner qualification rules and ecosystem access.  
  
All protocol actions are published in the data environment to ensure institutional accountability.  
  
⸻  
  
**8. Risk Summary**  
  
Participation in the protocol involves operational, technical and market risks. Functional outputs depend entirely on verified operational cycles and may be zero. DGTEnergy does not offer financial advice or guarantees of performance. Participants are responsible for security, compliance and proper use of Web3 tools.
