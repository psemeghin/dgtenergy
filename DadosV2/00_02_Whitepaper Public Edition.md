**1. Executive Summary**  
  
DGTEnergy is a utility token protocol that connects global participants to verified operational activity within Brazil’s energy transition. Through the DGT3 token, users gain access to participation utilities, governance visibility and a high transparency data environment.  
  
DGTEnergy does not operate as a fund, lender, broker, exchange or energy company. It functions as neutral infrastructure that organizes how operational data flows through an on-chain system engineered for auditability and regulatory alignment.  
  
DGT3 does not represent equity, debt, receivables or any type of financial instrument. It is strictly a utility token that enables access to protocol tools.  
  
⸻  
  
**2. Context and Opportunity**  
  
**2.1 Brazil’s Energy Transition**  
  
Beginning in 2026, more than ninety million consumers in Brazil will be able to choose their energy provider. This structural shift creates a large demand for consumer-level financing solutions with historically low delinquency due to regulated billing and the national clearing infrastructure managed by CCEE.  
  
**2.2 The Problem**  
  
Access to this operational environment remains limited, opaque and fragmented. Most operational flows are not visible to global participants, and there is no common infrastructure standard to expose real settlement data in a transparent format.  
  
**2.3 The DGTEnergy Approach**  
  
DGTEnergy does not attempt to replace market operators. It creates a protocol layer that connects to verified partners, structures monthly operational cycles and publishes standardized data. DGT3 is the utility token that coordinates access to this environment.  
  
This structure can be summarized as:  
One protocol, one token, one transparent access layer to real energy operations.  
  
⸻  
  
**3. What DGTEnergy Does**  
  
From a user perspective, DGTEnergy operates in three simple steps:  
  
**Step 1: Access**  
  
Users acquire DGT3 through the DGTEnergy DApp using USDT. This activates access to operational dashboards, participation utilities and governance visibility.  
  
**Step 2: Operational Cycles**  
  
Treasury deploys capital into verified energy financing partners, beginning with Billi. Partners deploy resources, generate receivables, settle them through regulated channels and return verified results to the protocol.  
  
These results form the basis of a monthly operational cycle processed by on-chain rules.  
  
**Step 3: Participation and Transparency**  
  
Users who activate staking gain access to structured participation logic and visibility into cycle data. All relevant actions of the protocol are published in a transparent and auditable format.  
  
At no point does this process convert DGT3 into a financial instrument.  
  
⸻  
  
**4. The DGT3 Utility Model**  
  
DGT3 is a fixed supply, non inflationary BEP 20 utility token.  
  
**4.1 Core Properties**  
  
Total supply: one billion  
Mint and burn: disabled  
Network: BNB Smart Chain  
Transferability: enabled at the contract level  
Initial secondary activity: restricted to the DGTEnergy P2P Desk under KYC rules  
  
**4.2 Utility Layers**  
  
**Access Utility**  
Users unlock dashboards and visibility into protocol activity.  
  
**Participation Utility**  
Users connect their staked DGT3 to monthly cycles under the one token one unit rule. Participation does not create new tokens.  
  
**Transparency and Governance Utility**  
Users gain visibility into protocol events and influence non financial governance parameters as the protocol evolves.  
  
DGT3 provides access only. It does not create ownership or financial rights.  
  
⸻  
  
**5. How the Protocol Works**  
  
This is the simplified user flow.  
  
**Acquire DGT3**  
Users participate in the Whitelist or public rounds and receive DGT3 in their wallets.  
  
**Activate Staking**  
Users choose to stake DGT3 and become eligible for participation in operational cycles, subject to snapshot rules.  
  
**Operational Cycle Execution**  
Treasury deploys USDT to verified partners. Partners perform their operations, settle receivables and send verified results to treasury.  
  
**Transparency and Eligibility**  
Data is published in a unified environment. Users can verify how each cycle is processed.  
  
**Observation Layer**  
All events are visible in a structured, auditable format.  
  
⸻  
  
**6. Distribution Structure**  
  
**6.1 Whitelist Phase**  
  
Price: 0.030 USDT per DGT3  
Purpose: launch infrastructure, establish the initial treasury base, and fund operational readiness.  
  
**6.2 Progressive Rounds**  
  
Seventy public rounds follow the Whitelist. Each round has a predefined price based on the official ladder. The full one billion supply is distributed through this deterministic model.  
  
The sale contract automatically splits incoming USDT between the treasury and the management fee wallet and instantly delivers DGT3 to participants.  
  
**6.3 Secondary Liquidity**  
  
Secondary activity begins through the DGTEnergy P2P Desk.  
The desk operates under the following restrictions:  
  
• KYC approval  
• Escrow settlement  
• No execution below the price floor relative to the official ladder  
• Treasury may operate only as a buyer, within defined limits  
  
External listings require future governance approval and regulatory review.  
  
⸻  
  
**7. Governance and Transparency**  
  
**7.1 Governance Philosophy**  
  
DGTEnergy separates immutable core rules from flexible protocol policy.  
  
Immutable rules include:  
Token supply  
Price ladder  
Distribution model  
Staking logic  
Desk pricing policy  
  
Governance can influence:  
Transparency standards  
Partner integrations  
Reinvestment parameters within limits  
Ecosystem development  
Non critical operational policies  
  
**7.2 Governance Phases**  
  
Phase 1: Institutional governance managed by a two of three multisig, with all actions disclosed publicly.  
Phase 2: Hybrid governance where the community signals preferences through voting, while multisig executes.  
Phase 3: DAO maturity, where governance expands to oversee broader policy matters while respecting immutable economics.  
  
**7.3 Transparency Layer**  
  
The DGTEnergy data environment exposes:  
Treasury movements  
Operational cycle confirmations  
Reinvestment activity  
Governance actions  
Fee flows  
Desk events  
  
This environment is publicly accessible and verifiable.  
  
⸻  
  
**8. Risk Summary**  
  
Participation in DGTEnergy involves exposure to operational, smart contract, liquidity, governance, regulatory and market risks. The protocol provides no guarantees, projections or assurances regarding operational outcomes. Allocations within participation cycles depend entirely on verified operational conditions and may be zero.  
  
Users remain responsible for wallet security, jurisdictional compliance and interpretation of protocol data. DGTEnergy does not provide investment, financial or legal advice.  
  
A full disclosure is available in the Institutional Extended Whitepaper.  
  
⸻

Roadmap milestones represent structural development, not performance expectations.  
  
⸻  
  
**10. Positioning**  
  
DGTEnergy positions itself as a long term institutional protocol that exposes verified operational activity through a transparent, auditable and rules based system.  
  
DGT3 is the gateway to this environment. It is a utility token that unlocks tools within a verifiable digital infrastructure, not a financial product.  
  
DGTEnergy prioritizes transparency, compliance and operational clarity over speculative behavior. This aligns the protocol with institutional standards and regulatory expectations.  
  
⸻  
  
**Compliance Notice**  
  
DGTEnergy is a utility token protocol. Participation grants access to protocol utilities only, including staking, governance and data visibility. Participation does not represent equity, debt or financial instruments. All allocations are performance based, discretionary and fully transparent on chain.
